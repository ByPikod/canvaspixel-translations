4. Open Poedit and click "Create new translation" or open an existing translation.

    - You should choose template file (`.pot`) from the `po` folder of the repository when you create a new translation.

5. Translate the strings and save the file. The file name should be the language code of the language you are translating to. You can find the language code [here](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php). For example, if you are translating to Spanish, the file name should be `es.po`.
